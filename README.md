# 🗺️ US States Game

An interactive U.S. states guessing game built using Python Turtle Graphics. Users guess state names and see them placed on the map, with unguessed states saved for later practice.

## ✨ Technologies

- `Python`
- `Turtle Graphics`
- `Pandas`
- `CSV`

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive state guessing via user input
- Correct guesses displayed directly on the map
- CSV-based state and coordinate data
- Automatically saves unguessed states to a file
- Clean, minimal UI for focused learning

## 📍 The Process

This project was built as **Day 25 of the 100 Days of Python Code** course to understand how to read and work with CSV files in Python. Pandas was used to efficiently load, analyze, and access tabular data containing U.S. state names and their coordinates.

If the user exits the game before guessing all states, the remaining states are saved to a new CSV file (`states_to_learn.csv`) so they can be reviewed and practiced later.

On **Day 26**, the project was improved using list and dictionary comprehension with conditionals. Iterating over Pandas DataFrames using list comprehension helped make the logic more concise and expressive, reinforcing Pythonic data handling techniques.

## 🚦 Running the Project

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the main file: `python main.py`  
3. Start guessing U.S. state names  
4. `Exit` to end the game and generate the learning CSV  
5. Click `Exit` to close the window
